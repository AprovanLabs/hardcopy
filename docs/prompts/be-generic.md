Be generic in your implementation. Think think thoroughly through the abstractions you create and consider if there is a more powerful variant that preserves functionality without major sacrifices.

- ALWAYS use a strong sense of module isolation
- Do NOT plan one-off variants or implementations, unless absolutely necessary and properly isolated.
- ALWAYS consider how the implementation will work long-term and be extensible.
- ALWAYS check with the user if there are open questions, conflicts, or fundamental issues with the approach.
