Prefer to be concise and simple with your approach. Avoid duplicated code and re-implementing exiting functionality. Always be aware of where code _should_ go.

- DO keep code in separated areas where possible
- DO keep implementation simple and free of comments
- Do NOT keep backwards compatibility. Break legacy implementations where needed and remove deprecated code.
- Re-factor and re-organize as-needed, as you go.
